### RadioWare Receiver configuration file ###
#############################################
#
# This file is used for configuring RadioWare Receiver daemon
# Every line must contains a single parameter, followed by its value.
# The first whitespace is used as separator between parameter and its value,
# so every content after the first whitespace is considered as value.
#
# E.g. :
#
#   Row: one two three
#
#   Param: "one"
#   Value: "two three"
#
# Every line is stripped in both starting and ending side in order to remove unuseful
# additional whitespace characters.
# Every empty line or line starting with a # are considered as comments and are
# ignored during the parsing of the configuration file.
